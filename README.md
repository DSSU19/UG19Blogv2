# Speak Your Mind 

![Speak your mind login page](https://github.com/DSSU19/UG19Blogv2/blob/main/SpeakYourMind.png)

Speak Your Mind is a secure web based blog where users can freely express
 their and popular or unpopular opinions as well as read others own 
without being judged. It has been coded to mitigate against the following 
security vulnerabilities:
1. Account enumeration
2. Session hijacking
3. SQL injection
4. Cross-site scripting
5. Cross-site request forgery
6. DDOS
7. ClickJacking


## Overview

The following explains how Speak Your Mind works at high-level:
1. User signs-up using a valid email
2. User must verify their email
3. If totp is selected as authentication, user must set up their totp. If email selected, email is verified and user will be re-directed to login. 
4. User inputs their login and email and is transferred to their selected Two Factor Authentication (2FA) Method. 
5. User is authenticated after completing their chosen 2FA method. 
6. User is authenticated and can now add,edit,and delete their blog posts.
7. Users can read and search other blog posts.




## Implementation

The application is a web application whereby the front end is written using
HTML, CSS, EJS and JavaScript whiles the backend is written using Node.js and Express.
It stores and retrieves data from PostGresSQL.

## Installation

### Install Node.js packages
The following node.js packages needs to be installed for the program to work:
express, https, body-parser, node-mailer, fs, ejs, crypto, node-postgres and many more. 
To summarise, ensure that all packages listed in the server.js file are properly installed. 
You can do so by typing this command in terminal e.g: To install node-postgres run the following:
```
npm install pg  
```

### Generate Self-Signed SSL/TS certificate
The website is connected through Node.js https server. This requires
self-signed certificates for this to work. To attain this certificates you will need 
to go to terminal and type the following commands:

1. Generate a private key file 
```
openssl genrsa -out mydomain.local+3-key.pem 2048
```
2. Generating a certificate signing request
```
openssl req -new -key mydomain.local+3-key.pem -out mydomain.local+3.csr
```
3. Generate a self-signed SSL certificate
```
openssl x509 -req -in mydomain.local+3.csr -signkey mydomain.local+3-key.pem -out mydomain.local+3.pem
```
If you want to change the names of the files make sure to change the filename of the
code that reads the files as shown below:
```javascript
const options = {
    key: fs.readFileSync('mydomain.local+3-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('mydomain.local+3.pem')
};
const server = https.createServer(options, app);
server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('Server running at https://localhost:8080/');
});
```
Once this is done, confirm that your server is running successfully by 
going to terminal and typing the following:
```
node server.js
```
The above will run the server.js file. Although, everything has 
been installed, the application won't function properly because
the PostgreSQL database needs to be set up. 

##  Captcha Configuration
You need to set up a captcha in order for your version of the application to work. 
To do this you must:
 1. Create a Google reCAPTCHA Account using v2 on this link: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
 2. Follow the reCaptcha v2 documentation: https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display to configure your captcha. 

## Docker

The application can be cloned and run using Docker. 
If you have docker installed or you have to do is run the docker compose command below:

```
docker-compose up --build
```
If not, you would first have to download Docker from their official website. 

## Database Configuration
Alternatively, if you don't want to use Docker, you may have to set up the database
in order for the application to work properly. 
Below is an Entity Relationship Diagram to help you be able to set up a database.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users ||--o|totp : HAS
    users ||--o|otps: HAS
    users ||--o{blogdata: HAS
    
    users {
        integer id PK
        varchar password
        varchar email
        bool isverified
        varchar verificationtoken
        varchar firstname
        bigint creationtime
        authmethod authmethod

    }
    totp{
        varchar email PK, FK
        varchar secret
    }
    otps{
        varchar email PK, FK
        varchar otp
        bool   used
        bigint creationtime
    }

    blogdata{
        bigint id PK
        varchar blogtitle
        text bloginfo
        timestamp datecreated
        varchar blogdescription
        varchar blogauthor
        integer user_id  FK
    }
```
    

Below is additional information you need to complete
the database configuration:

Kindly note that the "public" 
is the default name of the database schema.
If you change the schema name to anything else,
then public should be changed to the new schema name. 

1. The type authmethod is an enum type created
using the following SQL query:
```postgresql
CREATE TYPE public.authmethod AS ENUM (
    'email',
    'totp'
);
```
2. You will need to set all the ids to have auto
increment. 
   ```postgresql
   /*Set the user id to autoincrement*/
   CREATE SEQUENCE public.users_id_seq1
    AS integer
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    NO MINVALUE
    NO MAXVALUE
    CACHE 1;
   
   ALTER SEQUENCE public.users_id_seq1 OWNED BY public.users.id;

   /*Set the blog data id to autoincrement*/
   CREATE SEQUENCE public."blogData_id_seq"
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    NO MINVALUE
    NO MAXVALUE
    CACHE 1;
   
   ALTER SEQUENCE public."blogData_id_seq" OWNED BY public.blogdata.id;
   ```

### User Roles
In the application you will need to create 3 different types of user roles:
1. A read-write user that only has permissions to select on all the tables:
    An example can be seen down below. You can change the password, the name
   of the user and the blogdatabase name to one of your choice
```postgresql
CREATE ROLE readonly_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'mypassword' NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydatabase TO readonly_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
```
2. A write-only user that permissions to insert, delete, and update all the tables
in the database
  ```postgresql
CREATE ROLE writeonly_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'mypassword' NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydatabase TO writeonly_user;
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO writeonly_user;
GRANT USAGE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO writeonly_user;
``` 

3. A readwrite user that selects, inserts, delete, update and delete the data on all the database. 
  ```postgresql
CREATE ROLE writeonly_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'mypassword' NOSUPERUSER NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydatabase TO writeonly_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO writeonly_user;
GRANT USAGE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO writeonly_user;
``` 


### Pool Instance Configuration:
In the code a new pool instance is created to connect to the database through pg client. An example can be
shown in the code below:
```javascript
//Switches the database name based on whether we are testing or using the actual application
const databaseName = process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" ? process.env.testDatabase : process.env.database;

const pool = new Pool({
    host: process.env.localhost,
    port: process.env.port,
    user: process.env.user, //name of the readwriteuser
    database: databaseName,
    password:  process.env.password,//password of the readwrite user created
});

const readOnlyPool = new Pool({
    host: process.env.localhost,
    port: process.env.port,
    user: process.env.readOnlyUser, //name of the readonlyuser
    database: databaseName,
    password:  process.env.readOnlyUserPassword, //password of the readonlyuser
});

const writeOnlyPool = new Pool({
    host: process.env.localhost,
    port: process.env.port,
    user: process.env.writeOnlyUser,
    database: databaseName,
    password:  process.env.writeOnlyUserPassword,
});
```
In your .env file you need to place the appropriate pool configurations in there. Ensure that the 
user and password is the name and password of the readwrite user that you created. Similarly,

###Dot env configuration
Ensure that in your env file, you have all of the following configurations accurately
filled. A template of the <b> .env </b> file can be seen below
```dotenv
# Database Configuration
user = ''     #this is the readwrite user created. 
readOnlyUser = ''
writeOnlyUser = ''
port = ''
host = ''
password = ''
readOnlyUserPassword = ''
writeOnlyUserPassword = ''
database =''
testDatabase = ''
# Configurations to send email via node-mailer transporter
email_port = '' 
email_host = ''
email_secure = ''
email_user =  ''
email_pass=  ''

# Secret keys to ensure other blog functionalities work properly
secret_key = ''
cookie_secret_key = ''
recaptcha_secret_key = ''
token_secret_key = ''
encryption_key = ''
encryption_iv = ''
test_csrf_token = ''
```
